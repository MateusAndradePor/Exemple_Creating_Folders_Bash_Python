# Shell Script file:
The script install the last version of pyhton, if necessary, and execute 2 python scripts: the workspace creator and the calculator.<br>
It allows the user to repeat the process and create another workspace (just a folder with some test empty files).

# Python Scripts:
The first .py file executes a simple input, that requires a new username, then creates a folder with this username with some text files inside, simulating the apps that could be installed.
The second .py is a simple calculator, that can make the basic operations as many times as user wants.
